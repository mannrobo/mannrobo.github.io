Some Assembly Required was founded in the 2015-2016 season, Nothing But Net, by two brothers, Patrick & Brendan McGuire, and their friends Tyler Mulea and Francis Villeneuva. Their first year, they qualified for the state tournament via skills scores at the J.L. Mann Upstate VEX Qualifier, the first team to qualify in the history of the organization.

Their next year, StarStruck, was a building year for them. They again competed at the state tournament thanks to skills scores at the VRC Upstate Skills Challenge. In The Zone was a wonderful season for them: their first tournament, the J.L. Mann Upstate Qualifier did not go well at all. But they persevered and completely rebuilt, and won their next tournament with 52455A Eagle Robotics from Beaufort, and 67864D E404 from North Augusta, South Carolina. 

At The Final Countdown VEX Duals, they ranked extremely well, and faced off in eliminations against 67864D, the very team they won with the week before (and lost!) At the State Tournament, they unfortunately encountered an electronics error, but was still able to do fairly well.

Their first Turning Point Competition will be the Mann Robotics Fall Qualifier on November 17, 2018
