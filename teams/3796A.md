Mann Made is our first team, founded in the 2014-2015 season, Skyrise (under another team number), and they have existed continuously since. They started to reach success in Nothing But Net, where they ranked 6th in our own tournament, and lost after a very close finals match. StarStruck was the first year they qualified for the state tournament, based on skills scores they earned at the VRC Upstate Skills Challenge.

In The Zone was a very good year for them, where they won their first ever notebook award at the Clover MS & HS Qualifier, where they were extremely competitive.

Their first Turning Point Competition will be the Mann Robotics Fall Qualifier on November 17, 2018

This year team A is solely working on a six bar lift that is able to flip, pick up, and score cones on all four posts. We have made considerable improvements since our first tournament and feel fairly confident in our ability to progress to state.
