Community involvement is important to Mann Robotics. Keeping with this spirit Mann Robotics has implemented a mentorship program to assist Sevier Middle School's 8 teams (8686B, 8686G, 8686H, 8686J, 8686K, 8686M, 8686N, and 8686P). We have assisted their teams at their school and at events, and have developed a partnership with their program, as many of their students will attend J.L. Mann High School in the future.

In past years, Mann Robotics has worked with Clemson's VEXU team BCUZ and other Greenville area teams to volunteer at Sevier's Falcon's Middle School Qualifier, and have done so for 4 years and counting. At the most recent Sevier event, Brendan McGuire was awarded with Volunteer of the Year for his service as the Head Referee.
