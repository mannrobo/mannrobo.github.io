In late 2017, team 3796B created a Discord server, a small IRC-style chatroom with voice capability, for South Carolina VEX teams. The server provides an easy-to-access network of VEX participants across the state and beyond, which makes for an inviting community which is quick to answer you if you have a question. Currently, the server holds 93 members, from middle school to college, and a bot programmed to help teams easily access team performances and to help manage the server.
